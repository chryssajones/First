	<p>Hi, my name is Chryssa Jones, and I'm an aspiring developer.  I am currently enrolled in the Full Stack Developer Boot Camp at UC San Diego, where I also work full-time as a student affairs administrator.  I am the coordinator of the Student Veterans Resource Center at UC San Diego, and I've been in this line of work for about 7 years now.  It's a good job, I'm good at it, and I enjoy it (most days), but it's not what I want to spend the rest of my career doing.  So, I'm pursuing a career change and this boot camp is the first step!</p>
